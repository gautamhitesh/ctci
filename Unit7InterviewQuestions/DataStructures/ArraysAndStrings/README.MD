# Arrays and Strings
## Notes
1. Hash Tables
2. Arrays
3. ArrayLists
4. Amortized Insertion Time
5. String Builder

## Problems
1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structure?

Ans:
    1. Brute-force: Traverse the string for every character from the beginning to check if there exists another copy of it.
    2. Using Hashing (uses additional data structure): create an array of positions and increment the position value
